## Final Report

**Introduction**
As business management students, we are interested in seeing how the impact of Covid 19 on economies and trades may be analysed using financial data. This topic is of interest to us since it has the potential to become a marketable talent in the near future. In the midst of the frenzy that has been generated by cryptocurrencies and other developments in financial technology, the purpose of the analytics research that we are doing is to examine how far regulated securities have progressed. To be more specific, our objective is to identify significant anomalies in the financial markets. Although though we are aware of the possibility of creating a dashboard that is geared towards other users, we are not yet at a stage in the development of the project where we are able to determine how to take that step.

 Plan of Analysis: This study will compare mutual fund returns to those of the S&P 500 index over the previous 10 years using statistical methodologies. As part of the study, I will determine the yearly returns of mutual funds and the S&P 500 index. I will clean up the data to track only the funds that out performed the S&P 500 in the year 2009 to remove the smaller institiutions. Here is a link to the [Analysis](/Users/nyams/Desktop/School/Data_301/project-group-group-57/analysis/analysis_Kojo_Clarke.ipynb)

 Results: Yes, Mutual funds have consistently outperfromed the S&P 500. There are those who performed below the S&P 500, however many funds have consistently returned higher % returns
