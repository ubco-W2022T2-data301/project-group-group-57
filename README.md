The dataset our group used was collected and provided by Yahoo Finance. The dataset contains all U.S. Mutual Funds, and along with their historical prices, which includes 23,783 mutual funds and 2,310 ETFs with their general fund aspects, portfolio indicators, financial ratios, and more. All mutual funds have a clear investment mandate that specifies whether the fund invests in large or small companies, and whether those companies exhibit growth or value characteristics. Assume that the mutual fund manager will stick to the stated investment goals. Understanding a fund's specific investment mandate is a good start, but only a deeper dig into a fund's portfolio over time can reveal more about a fund's performance. The goal for this dataset is to allow for multiple comparisons of portfolio decisions of mutual fund managers and portfolio constraints of ETF indices. The dataset helps determine whether managers and investors are driving performance through asset allocation (top-down) or security selection (bottom-up) analysis. The results of this analysis can be compared with the stated mandate of the fund and the process of the fund manager.
