## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

As business management students, we are interested in seeing how the impact of Covid 19 on economies and trades may be analysed using financial data. This topic is of interest to us since it has the potential to become a marketable talent in the near future. In the midst of the frenzy that has been generated by cryptocurrencies and other developments in financial technology, the purpose of the analytics research that we are doing is to examine how far regulated securities have progressed. To be more specific, our objective is to identify significant anomalies in the financial markets. Although though we are aware of the possibility of creating a dashboard that is geared towards other users, we are not yet at a stage in the development of the project where we are able to determine how to take that step.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset our group used was collected and provided by Yahoo Finance. The dataset contains all U.S. Mutual Funds, and along with their historical prices, which includes 23,783 mutual funds and 2,310 ETFs with their general fund aspects, portfolio indicators, financial ratios, and more. All mutual funds have a clear investment mandate that specifies whether the fund invests in large or small companies, and whether those companies exhibit growth or value characteristics. Assume that the mutual fund manager will stick to the stated investment goals. Understanding a fund's specific investment mandate is a good start, but only a deeper dig into a fund's portfolio over time can reveal more about a fund's performance. The goal for this dataset is to allow for multiple comparisons of portfolio decisions of mutual fund managers and portfolio constraints of ETF indices. The dataset helps determine whether managers and investors are driving performance through asset allocation (top-down) or security selection (bottom-up) analysis. The results of this analysis can be compared with the stated mandate of the fund and the process of the fund manager.
