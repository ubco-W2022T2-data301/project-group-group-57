# Project Vision

Our objective for the Data Science course project is to discover if Warren Buffett's wager on the S&P 500 versus the Hedge fund sector will be successful in a post-pandemic financial world. We want to construct a financial model that tracks the returns of several mutual funds and the S & P 500 during the next six weeks. Our objective is to evaluate who has generated more returns over the previous five years. We are a team committed to continually learning and enhancing our abilities and knowledge, and we feel we can acquire the skills necessary to produce a data model worthy of an A in this course.
